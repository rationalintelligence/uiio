Implementation of the interactive `uiio` protocol for simple transmission
of actions displayed in the user interface.

Essentially, it works as a set of instructions read and executed by
a visualizer (like [hug](https://github.com/rationalintelligence/hug))
to achieve a zero-code approach to UI and visualization.
This is especially useful for creating small services and bots.
